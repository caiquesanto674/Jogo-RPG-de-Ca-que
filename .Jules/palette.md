## 2024-07-25 - CLI Output as UX

**Learning:** For text-based command-line applications, the formatted output *is* the user interface. Applying simple formatting techniques, like ensuring columns in a summary report are perfectly aligned, is a high-impact, low-effort micro-UX improvement. It significantly enhances readability and professionalism.

**Action:** When working on CLI tools, actively look for opportunities to format output for clarity. Don't just print data; present it. Use dynamic padding and alignment to create scannable, well-structured text reports.
